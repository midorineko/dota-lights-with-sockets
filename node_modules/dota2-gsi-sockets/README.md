# Node.js Dota 2 GSI module (using websockets)

`dota2-gsi-sockets` provides an event driven interface for Dota 2's live GameState Integration data. When configured, the Dota client will send regular messages to the `dota2-gsi-sockets` server, which emits an event for each attribute whenever it changes.

This package is a fork of `dota2-gsi`, which performs the same function using EventEmitter instead of sockets.

## Installation

`npm install dota2-gsi-sockets`

## Usage

```javascript
var d2gsi = require('dota2-gsi-sockets');
var server = new d2gsi([options]);
```

The server can be configured by passing an optional object to the constructor:
```
{
    port: The port that the server should listen on (default: 3000),
    ip: The IP address that the server should listen on (default: "0.0.0.0"),
    tokens: A single string or array of strings that are valid auth tokens (default: no auth required)
}
```

Once started, the server will accept socket requests to the supplied IP address and port, and begin emitting game data when it's available.

## Examples

Using events
```javascript
var d2gsi = require('dota2-gsi-sockets');
var io = require('socket.io-client');
var server = new d2gsi();

// Connect to the socket
var socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

socket.on('newclient', (client) => {
    console.log("New client connection, IP address: " + client.ip);
    if (client.auth && client.auth.token) {
        console.log("Auth token: " + client.auth.token);
    } else {
        console.log("No Auth token");
    }
});

socket.on('draft:activeteam', (msg) => {
    console.log("The active team drafting has changed to " + msg);
});

socket.on('hero:team2:player0:alive', (isAlive) => {
    if (isAlive) {
        console.log("Player 0 has respawned");
    } else {
        console.log("Player 0 has been killed!");
    }
});

```

## Events

The server will emit the following events to all connected sockets any time they change. This list may not be complete, as Valve can silently change the key names or add news ones at any time. If you discover some new outputs, please send a pull request!

All ```team#``` references may either be ```team2``` for Radiant, or ```team3``` for Dire. All ```player#``` references range from ```player0``` to ```player9```, where 0-4 are the Radiant team and 5-9 are the Dire.

## Quirks
* The Dota client does not announce all keys in an 'added' event, so there's no initial emit for some child attributes. This includes all of `provider`, `map`, and some of `player`. If you're trying to initialise values such as `map:daytime`, the easiest way to achieve it is to wait on the first `map:gametime` event then manually query the values from the gamestate.
* Item and hero names are returned as strings using the console format. Dota 2 Wiki has a list of translations for [items](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cheats#Item_names) and [heroes](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cheats#Hero_names).


## Configuring the Dota 2 Client

To configure the Dota client to report gamestate, you need to add a config file in `steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg\gamestate_integration\`. The file must use the name pattern called `gamestate_integration_*.cfg`, for example `gamestate_integration_dota2-gsi.cfg`.

The following example is included in this repository, you can copy it straight into your Dota directory to get started.
```
"dota2-gsi Configuration"
{
    "uri"               "http://localhost:3000/"
    "timeout"           "5.0"
    "buffer"            "0.1"
    "throttle"          "0.1"
    "heartbeat"         "30.0"
    "data"
    {
        "buildings"     "1"
        "provider"      "1"
        "map"           "1"
        "player"        "1"
        "hero"          "1"
        "abilities"     "1"
        "items"         "1"
        "draft"         "1"
        "wearables"     "1"
    }
    "auth"
    {
        "token"         "hello1234"
    }
}
```

## Caveats

Full player data is now available, but only to spectators and observers (as one would expect). The existing single player GSI data is still available, however the names of events are different to what is listed above. Please refer to previous versions of this readme or uncomment the console logging in index.js to see which keys are available
